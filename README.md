- anagram groups:

Fast anagram groups finder in C++ and Python.

- rotate in place:

Rotates a one dimensional vector of n elements left by i positions. For instance, if n=8 and i=3 the vector abcdefgh is rotated to defghabc. Simple code would use an intermediate vector element to do the job in n steps, but it can be done in O(n) using only a little more storage.
